Arrow of Time
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mossblaser/Arrow-of-Time.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mossblaser/Arrow-of-Time)

An implementation of Andrew Webb's universe model in which entopy (number of
non-A particles) increases no matter which direction time advances except
following a small number of starting states.

Currently not working!
